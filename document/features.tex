\item 208 parallel memory write units
\item 1 DMA unit for wide and fast DDR4 access 
\item 1 RISC-V control and reconfiguration CPU
\item Instruction and data caches
\item RS232 interfaces for viewing runtime messages
\item 16-bit convolution data size
\item 15 FPS execution speed (scalable upon availability of bandwidth and compute resources)
\item 2-frame latency (from first pixel in to first classification set out)
\item Frequency of operation at 125MHz
\item Needs external DDR4 memory controller IP
