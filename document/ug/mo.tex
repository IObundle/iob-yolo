Figure~\ref{fig:mo} represents the memory regions used by the Tiny Yolo V3 core.
The Tiny Yolo V3 binary and reserved memory space are placed in a contiguous 
memory region starting in \texttt{START\_ADDR} with a size of \texttt{YoloMem} 
32-bit words. 

The input and output image are placed in two regions starting in 
\texttt{IMG\_IN\_ADDR} and \texttt{IMG\_OUT\_ADDR} respectively.
